This document contains two programming questions that you can solve with a programming language of your
choice. We expect you to spend no more than 90 minutes on this assessment. Though we do not have any real way
to measure that, we trust that you will honour our request.
If you have any question around any of the problem, please make reasonable assumptions and call out those
assumptions in your response.
We would like you to share your response with us on codeshare.io.
Good luck.
Question 1:
Write a program that takes as input an array of positive and negative numbers (0 excluded). The objective is to
return those items from the array whose sum is 0. If no such items exist return “No Elements found”
Example: For an input array [-4, 1, 3, -2, -1],
one of the possible results would be 3, -2, -1 since their sum is 0.
Note: If there are more than 1 combination of such items, you can return any 1 of them.
Please share your code response on codeshare.io. In addition to this, please also specify the Time complexity (Big
O notation) and Space complexity (Big O notation) for your solution as well as all possible test cases.

Question 2:
Please implement a software for a car service station using Object Oriented Programming. If you are not familiar or
comfortable with object-oriented programming, we suggest you give this article a quick read to ensure you
understand it before you attempt it.
It should have the following features:
The car service station caters to different types of cars – Hatchback, Sedan, SUV.
It provides different types of services like Basic Service, Engine Fixing, Clutch Fixing, Gear Fixing and Brake Fixing.
Each service has a service code associated with it and different prices for different types of cars.
Service Code Service Hatchback Sedan SUV
BS01 Basic Servicing ₹ 2000 ₹ 4000 ₹ 5000
EF01 Engine Fixing ₹ 5000 ₹ 8000 ₹ 10000
CF01 Clutch Fixing ₹ 2000 ₹ 4000 ₹ 6000
BF01 Brake Fixing ₹ 1000 ₹ 1500 ₹ 2500
GF01 Gear Fixing ₹ 3000 ₹ 6000 ₹ 8000
The software should generate a detailed bill with the total amount for each service request based on the Type of
Car specified and the requested Service Codes.
Example:
Type of Car – Hatchback
Service Codes – BS01, EF01
Charges for Basic Servicing – ₹ 2000
Charges for Engine Fixing – ₹ 5000
Total Bill – ₹ 7000
In addition, if the total service bill is more than ₹ 10000, a complimentary cleaning should be provided and specified
in the bill.
